# ZUC
Implementation for [GM/T 0001-2012 ZUC stream cipher](http://www.oscca.gov.cn/Column/Column_32.htm) in C and Node.js.

The ZUC algorithm were designed by [DACAS, the Data Assurance and Communication Security Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://dacas.iie.cas.cn/).
It is now the standard commercial stream cipher in China. It was originally designed for use in LTE.

See also GM/T 0002-2012 SM4 block cipher, GM/T 0003-2012 SM2 ECC algorithm, and GM/T 0004-2012 SM3 hash algoritm.
SM stands for 商密(shāng mì), which is 商用密码(Commercial Cryptography) for short.
Commercial cryptography standard is regulated by [OSCCA(Office of the State Commercial Cryptography Administration)](http://www.oscca.gov.cn/).
OSCCA is basically a weaker counterpart of NSA in China.
