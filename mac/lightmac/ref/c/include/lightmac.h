/**
 * Filename: lightmac.h
 * Author: Atul Luykx
 *
 * The files "lightmac.h" and "lightmac.c" contain an implementation
 * of the Message Authentication Code (MAC) mode of operation LightMAC
 * as described in https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/190 and presented at
 * Fast Software Encryption 2016 in Bochum, Germany. This file
 * includes the headers of the two functions which expose the
 * functionality of the MAC, namely tag and verify. However in order
 * to fully specify a MAC, the following parameters need to be fixed:
 * - the block cipher,
 * - the tag length, and
 * - the counter length.

 * Fixing the parameters involves implementing BCEncrypt, and defining
 * the following macros in a "parameters.h" file:
 * COUNTER_LENGTH -- the length of the counters in bytes
 * TAG_LENGTH     -- the tag length in bytes
 * BLOCK_LENGTH   -- the block cipher block length in bytes
 * BC_KEY_LENGTH  -- the block cipher key length in bytes

 * The following equations translate between the symbols of the design
 * document (https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/190) and the parameters
 * described above:
 * s = 8*COUNTER_LENGTH
 * t = 8*TAG_LENGTH
 * n = 8*BLOCK_LENGTH
 * k = 8*BC_KEY_LENGTH
 * E = BCEncrypt
