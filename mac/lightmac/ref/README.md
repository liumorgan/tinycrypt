Reference implementation of the LightMAC mode of operation

LightMAC is a MAC (Message Authentication Code) mode of operation for block ciphers which can function as a PRF as well. The algorithm is described and analyzed in [the academic paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/190) and was presented at the Fast Software Encryption 2016 conference in Bochum, Germany.
